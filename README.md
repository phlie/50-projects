# 50-projects
My repository for a course I am doing on modern web development using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Why

- I think my best option for self employment is to just get better at web development and hopefully manage to get a work at home job I can do for around 30 hours per week, I know some web development but I thought a more modern approach might land me my first job, whether freelance or for another company.

## Copyright

- All Rights Reserved, the course is the property of another and this code is only meant for demonstration purposes to demonstrate that I know the basics of web development.
